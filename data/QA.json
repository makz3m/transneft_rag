        "context": "Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( (x_1, ..., x_n) ) to a sequence of continuous representations ( z = (z_1, ..., z_n) ). Given ( z ), the decoder then generates an output sequence ( (y_1, ..., y_m) ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step, the model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.The Transformer follows a specific architecture that utilizes stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\nEncoder: The encoder consists of a stack of ( N = 6 ) identical layers. Each layer contains two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. A residual connection is employed around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. Specifically, the output of each sub-layer is computed as ( \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{Sublayer}(x)) ), where ( \\text{Sublayer}(x) ) represents the function executed by the sub-layer. To support these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, including the embedding layers, produce outputs with a dimension of ( d_{\\text{model}} = 512 ).",

Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies. Hence, we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.",

Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin\n\nAffiliations: Google Brain, Google Research, University of Toronto\n\nAbstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",
